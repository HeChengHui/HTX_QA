# Stage 3

Stage 3 aims test the 6 huggingface models with practical dataset from the HTX website
1) Able to fit the News section of the HTX website to the models
2) Run the models on GPU

## Note
1) Running the models on GPU gives ~58 to ~74% faster timing and similar accuracy
2) Running the models on GPU uses vram so models 2,3 and 6 cannot be tested for me
